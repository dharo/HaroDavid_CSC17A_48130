Note to Dr. Lehr

Thanks for another great semester!

For Problem 1, it may or may not fail to run, there have been times when this will
happen from different machines in different OS (OSX, Ubuntu, Windows 8.1) I have 
attached the Problem 1 in its own Netbeans 8.0.2 Project that I know was running perfect
the last few times I tested it, however when the project was placed int he menu project, 
it would terminate during run.
